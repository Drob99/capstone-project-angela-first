<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a software engineering student at <b>King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals
(KFUPM)</b> with a passion for solving meaningful problems through technology. I am currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree
with a strong academic record and a growing portfolio of projects that reflect my curiosity, determination, and
commitment to continuous learning.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I have immersed myself in various aspects of computer science — from developing software applications and understanding the foundations of networking and databases to diving into artificial intelligence and machine learning. My interest in AI led me to join the <b>KAUST Academy AI Summer School</b>, where I worked on real-world projects, collaborated with passionate students from around the Kingdom, and deepened my understanding of AI models and diffusion networks. This experience strengthened my belief that AI can transform the way we live, work, and
learn—and I want to be part of that transformation.</p>

<p>One of my proudest accomplishments has been participating in undergraduate research initiatives, like taking a course in undergraduate research.
Although I am still new to research, I have found excitement in asking hard questions, reviewing literature, and
contributing to new ideas. I believe research is more than a requirement — it is a mindset that pushes us to think
critically, communicate clearly, and stay curious. I am especially interested in using AI for impactful applications,
such as education, accessibility, and health.</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom, I enjoy building projects that apply what I learn. Whether I am working with Python, experimenting
with PyTorch, debugging a C++ application, or managing code on GitHub, I love the process of turning an idea into a working solution. I am also exploring UI/UX design and web development to become a more versatile engineer.</p>

<p>I am someone who thrives on structure and growth. While I have faced moments of doubt or felt like I was not doing “enough” (and I still am),
I have learned that progress is about consistency. I do not have all the answers yet, but I show up every day to learn, improve, and build things I am proud of.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy chess (with a rapid rating around 2100), watching anime, reading, and having meaningful
conversations. I am also passionate about helping others — I have mentored peers, collaborated on group projects, and
supported friends through their own learning journeys. I believe that personal growth happens not only through
competition but also through community.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I am preparing for graduate studies or a future in tech roles that challenge me intellectually and align with my values. Whether it is pursuing a Master’s or Ph.D. at KAUST or contributing to forward-thinking companies like Google or Microsoft, I am eager to keep learning and growing. I believe my foundation in software engineering, combined
with a genuine drive to explore the unknown, will allow me to make meaningful contributions — both as a student and a
future researcher or engineer.</p>
